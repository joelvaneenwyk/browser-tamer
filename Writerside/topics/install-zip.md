# Install Manually

To install manually, go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aloneguid/bt/releases) and download the [latest version](https://github.com/aloneguid/bt/releases/latest) - look for a file with `.zip` extension.

Unpack `.zip` to any folder you like, and you are ready to run it.

<tip>
When installing manually, you can optionally enable <a href="portable-mode.md">portable mode</a>.
